# TexasHoldEm_Python
Texas hold-em poker game against NPC opponents, implemented in Python3.

## Notes
- Look up "solid principles" of object at orientated programming.
- Look up "Min Max A.I."

In a game of no-limit Texas hold'em, the minimum opening raise must be at least twice the big blind, and the maximum raise can be all of the chips a player has in his or her stack (an "all-in" bet).
In fixed-limit hold'em (or just "limit hold'em), a raise is always exactly twice the big blind.
